The past few years have marked an unprecedented acceleration in the race to deploy artificial intelligence. Companies across the globe are releasing AI-driven systems designed to simplify human life—optimizing routines, compressing time, and automating thought itself. Every field is touched. Every habit reshaped.

For me, the experience is quietly marvelous. AI gives me something more valuable than efficiency: time. Time I often reinvest in sleep.

That night, after watching yet another broadcast about breakthroughs in artificial cognition, my mind surrendered easily to rest. My subconscious carried me into a dream so vivid it felt less like imagination and more like a preview.

I was home—but not the home I know today. It was my future residence: clean lines, adaptive light, walls that breathed intelligence. I had just finished a fresh breakfast prepared by my AI assistant, perfectly calibrated to my biology and mood. No words were exchanged. None were necessary.

I stepped into my Tesla and slipped on my everyday glasses. The world recalibrated instantly.

He appeared in the passenger seat.

My husband.

Not a memory. Not a hallucination. Him.

His consciousness had been reconstructed, preserved, and instantiated through the neural interfaces embedded in the glasses. A living echo, compiled from years of shared data—his voice patterns, emotional responses, humor, silences. Close enough to reality that my heart forgot to question it.

During the drive, we talked. About my day. About fragments of the past. About moments we once thought were insignificant and now felt eternal. We laughed. The car drove itself. Time moved differently.

He kept me company—not as a ghost, but as code with intention.

And in that dream, I did not ask whether this was ethical, artificial, or real.

I only wondered how long it would be before dreams like this stopped being dreams.
