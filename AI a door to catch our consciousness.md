The past few years have marked an unprecedented acceleration in the race to deploy artificial intelligence. Companies across the globe are releasing AI-driven systems designed to simplify human life—optimizing routines, compressing time, and automating thought itself. Every field is touched. Every habit reshaped.

For me, the experience is quietly marvelous. AI gives me something more valuable than efficiency: time. Time I often reinvest in sleep.

That night, after watching yet another broadcast about breakthroughs in artificial cognition, my mind surrendered easily to rest. My subconscious carried me into a dream so vivid it felt less like imagination and more like a preview.

I was home—but not the home I know today. It was my future residence: clean lines, adaptive light, walls that breathed intelligence. I had just finished a fresh breakfast prepared by my AI assistant, perfectly calibrated to my biology and mood. No words were exchanged. None were necessary.

I stepped into my Tesla and slipped on my everyday glasses. The world recalibrated instantly.

It wasn’t a memory.
It wasn’t a hallucination.
It was him.

My husband materialized in the passenger seat.

His consciousness had been reconstructed, preserved, and instantiated through the neural interfaces integrated into the glasses. A living echo, compiled from years of shared data: his voice patterns, his emotional responses, his humor, his silences. So real that my heart forgot to doubt.

During the drive, we talked. About my day. About memories. About moments we once thought insignificant that now seemed eternal. We laughed. The car drove itself. Time passed differently.

When we finally arrived, I stepped out and instructed the vehicle to park itself in the assigned space within my gym’s smart parking system. The car complied silently, disappearing into a grid of autonomous motion.

Inside the gym, I entered a room specially equipped for cycling. I mounted the stationary bike, and my AI glasses synchronized instantly, overlaying reality with something else entirely.

The walls dissolved.

I was riding through a mountain trail deep within the Amazon rainforest. The air felt thick and alive. I could sense the incline, the resistance, the rhythm of my breath syncing with the terrain. Sunlight filtered through endless green. It was breathtaking.

Behind me, he followed—on his old bicycle, exactly as I remembered it.

We rode together in silence, accompanied by the sound of wind and leaves. Sharing a moment that should not have been possible, yet felt perfectly natural.

The wind was blowing from north to south when suddenly the alarm clock cut through the illusion.

I woke up.

The room was dark. The future vanished.

But the idea remained.

A dream—yes.
Yet not one that feels far from becoming reality.

Who knows.
Maybe in ten years.
Maybe in 2036.
