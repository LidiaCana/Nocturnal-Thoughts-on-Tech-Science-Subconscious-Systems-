##Prologue

It was the late 1990s.
A warm summer night, quiet enough to hear the universe breathe.

I woke abruptly, pulled from sleep by the residue of the strangest dream I had ever experienced. I was five years old. At that age, I knew nothing of physics, the cosmos, or dimensions beyond the visible. I had no language for what I saw—only the certainty that it was real.

Nearly thirty years have passed, and the memory has decayed, fragment by fragment. Yet the sensation remains.

I was suspended in a dark expanse, something between space and limbo. There were massive spheres drifting around me, colossal and silent, wrapped in textures that defied matter itself. They were not solid, nor liquid, nor gas. They existed in a state unknown to this world. Each sphere radiated an energy that did not merely surround me—it penetrated me, interacting directly with my own essence, as if my body were only a temporary interface.

That energy had weight. Frequency. Intention.

I understood, without understanding, that these objects did not originate from Earth. They belonged to a system older, wider, and indifferent to human time. And somehow, they were aware of me.

When I woke, the dream did not end. It embedded itself in me.

This book is a transmission of thoughts collected across years of silence and observation. Some are fiction. Some are technology. Some orbit science, while others drift toward spirituality. All of them emerge from the same question: what if reality is only one layer of a much larger system?

I do not claim to be an expert, a visionary, or a witness chosen by fate.

I am only a time traveler—lost between moments, gathering fragments of meaning, trying to remember the coordinates of home and return safely.
